Understanding the structure of the quantum chromodyanmic (QCD) vacuum is essential to explaining the properties of the strong nuclear force. In this work, we explore the centre vortex model for confinement, which has shown significant promise in recent years as an explanation for the distinctive long range properties of QCD. Specifically, we investigate the behaviour of the gluon propagator on original, vortex-only and vortex-removed gauge field configurations. We also present novel visualisation techniques that allow for close inspection of the properties of the vortex vacuum. This work further reinforces the significance of centre vortices in a fundamental understanding of QCD vacuum structure.
