Understanding the structure of the quantum chromodyanmic (QCD) vacuum is essential to explain the properties of the strong nuclear force. We explore a particular model known as the centre vortex model that has shown significant promise in recent years as an explanation for all the distinctive long range properties of QCD. We investigate the impact of centre vortices on the gluon propagator, and present novel visualisation techniques that allow for close inspection of the properties of the vortex vacuum. This work further reinforces the significance of centre vortices in a fundamental understanding of QCD vacuum structure.
