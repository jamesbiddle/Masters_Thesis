\begin{acknowledgements}      


I would like to acknowledge first and foremost my supervisors Prof.\ Derek Leinweber and Dr.\ Waseem Kamleh for their invaluable support and guidance throughout my masters. I also cannot understate my appreciation of my fellow postgrads; Rob, Riley, Josh, Andre, Zach, Chris, Ryan, Theo, Jason, Alex, Sophie, Kim and Abbishek have all been wonderful companions over the last two years. From long physics rants, to futurology and Dyson spheres, to D\&D and Overwatch, my masters would not have been the same without you. A special thanks goes to Sophie for her assistance with thesis drafting as well.\\

My friends have shown endless support, and I greatly appreciate all the polite nodding whenever I tried to explain what it is that I actually do. Spending time with friends has been essential for my sanity throughout this degree. My girlfriend Kate especially has been a truly amazing source of happiness, responding to my long uni hours and stressed-out moments with unfailing rationality and optimism. Finally, I would like to thank my family, particularly my mum and dad, for their constant love and support.
