\textit{A brief discussion of the work presented in this chapter will appear in the proceedings ``Visualizations of Centre Vortex Structure in Lattice Simulations'', }\citet{Biddle:2018a} \textit{and ``Publicizing Lattice Field Theory through Visualization'', }\citet{Biddle:2018b}.\\

\textit{The digital version of this chapter contains interactive 3D models embedded in the document. To interact with these models, it is necessary to open the document in Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat (requires version 9 or newer). Linux users should install Adobe acroread version 9.4.1, the last edition to have full 3D support. Note that 3D content must also be enabled for the interactive content to be available, and for proper rendering it is necessary to enable double-sided rendering in the preferences menu. To view the models, click on the figures marked as \textbf{Interactive} in the caption. To rotate the model, click and hold the left mouse button and move the mouse. Use the scroll wheel or shift-click to zoom. Some pre-set views of the model are also provided to highlight areas of interest. To reset the model back to its original orientation and zoom, press the ‘home’ icon in the toolbar or change the view to ‘Default view’.}\\

In previous chapters we have motivated the significance of centre vortices in QCD through the calculation of the gluon propagator. Although we can predict many of the properties of vortices through calculation, these properties can also be explored through visualisations of the lattice. To this end, in this chapter we present a novel visualisation technique that allows us to view thin centre vortices on the lattice through the use of 3D models~\footnote{All 3D models have been generated using Advanced Visual Systems (AVS) Express Visualisation Edition, version 8.4.1.}. These models allow for a highly interactive exploration of the vortex structure of the QCD vacuum.

\section{Spatially-Oriented Vortices}
As the lattice is a four-dimensional hypercube, we visualise the centre vortices on a set of 3D slices. The choice of dimension to take slices along is irrelevant in Euclidean space, so to maximise the volume of each slice we choose to take slices along the $x$-axis, resulting in $N_x$ slices each with dimensions $N_y\times N_z\times N_t$. However, the transition between slices is most intuitively thought of as `stepping though time', so we re-label our coordinates such that each slice is considered to be a snapshot at fixed $t$, with local coordinates $(x,y,z)$. Within each slice we can visualise all vortices associated with an $x-y$, $x-z$ or $y-z$ plaquette by calculating $P_{x\,y}(\bf{x})$, $P_{y\,z}(\bf{x})$ and $P_{z\,x}(\bf{x})$ for all $\bf{x}$ in the slice. These vortices will be referred to as the `spatially-oriented' vortices, as they are fixed in time. The plaquettes are evaluated on a centre projected configuration, so $P_{\mu\nu}\in \lbrace -1,\,0,\,+1\rbrace$. For a $+1$ vortex, a blue jet is plotted piercing the centre of the plaquette, and for a $-1$ vortex a red jet is plotted. The direction of the jet is set according to a right-hand rule, such that
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0pt,labelsep=12pt]
\item $P_{x\,y}=\pm 1\implies \pm\hat{z}$ direction.
\item $P_{y\,z}=\pm 1\implies \pm\hat{x}$ direction.
\item $P_{x\,z}=\pm 1\implies \mp\hat{y}$ direction,
\end{itemize}
An example of this plotting convention is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SpacialVortices}.\\

The 3D slices for $t=1,2$ with the spatially-oriented vortices plotted appear as in Figs.~\ref{fig:PlaqT01}, \ref{fig:PlaqT02}. At first glance the vortex structure appears highly complex, and it is difficult to identify the significant features. As such, we make use of the 3D models to hone in and isolate the important features present in these slices. We present some of these features in Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexFeatures}.\\

It is an excellent sanity check to see that the vortices do indeed form closed lines, as they must to conserve the centre flux and satisfy the Bianchi identity~\cite{Engelhardt:2003wm,Spengler:2018dxt}. We also observe that the vortex loops tend to be large. This agrees with the observation made of $SU(2)$ vortices in Refs.~\cite{Engelhardt:1999fd,Bertle:1999tw} that below the critical deconfinement temperature, $T_C$, almost all vortices identified had the maximum possible extent. It will be the subject of future work to investigate whether as the temperature increases the $SU(3)$ vortex loops begin to shrink and cease to percolate, indicating a transition to the deconfining phase.\\

The presence of branching/monopole points is of particular interest, as previous studies have primarily focussed on $SU(2)$ theory which is free from these structures. This is because it is only in $SU(3)$ (or more generally, $SU(N)$ with $N>2$) that it is possible to conserve the centre flux at the intersection of 3 vortices, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexBranching}. It is clear from our visualisations that these points occur frequently in the confining phase, in agreement with the findings of Ref.~\cite{Spengler:2018dxt}. The ambiguity between monopoles and branching points arises from the lack of definite orientation for the vortex line. With our plotting convention, each jet can be thought of as indicating directed flow of $+1$ centre charge. However, this is entirely equivalent to picturing $-1$ charge flowing in the direction opposite to the jet due to the fact that the $P_{\mu\nu} = P_{\nu\mu}^\dagger$, so calculating the plaquette with the opposite orientation will give the opposite charge. Furthermore, because $\exp(2\pi i/3) = \exp(-4\pi i/3)$, one unit of positive charge is equivalent to two units of negative charge (and vice-versa), and hence we could also interpret our models as representing the directed flow of two units of negative charge. This ambiguity is highlighted in Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexBranching}, where we see the equivalence between a branching point and a monopole.  Although it may seem to be a drawback, the lack of definite orientation for vortices is also an important property of the vortex model, as it permits non-vanishing topological charge~\cite{Engelhardt:2010ft,Engelhardt:1999xw}. It is nevertheless important to keep in mind the presence of this ambiguity when visualising the vortex vacuum.

By considering the charge of the left-most vortex flowing in the opposite direction, these two diagrams can be interchanged.}

\section{Spacetime-oriented Vortices}
For each link in a given 3D slice there are two additional plaquettes that lie in the $x_i - t$ plane, pointing in the positive and negative time directions. Vortices associated with spacetime-oriented plaquettes contain information about the way the line-like vortices evolve with time, or equivalently, how the vortex surfaces appear in four dimensions. In a given 3D slice we only have access to one link associated with a spacetime-oriented vortex, and as such we plot an arrow along this link to indicate its association with this vortex. We adopt the following plotting convention for these spacetime-oriented vortices:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0pt,labelsep=12pt]
\item  \makebox[13em][l]{$+1$ vortex, forward in time}  $\implies$ cyan arrow, positively oriented.
\item  \makebox[13em][l]{$+1$ vortex, backward in time} $\implies$ cyan arrow, negatively oriented.
\item  \makebox[13em][l]{$-1$ vortex, forward in time}  $\implies$ orange arrow, positively oriented.
\item  \makebox[13em][l]{$-1$ vortex, backward in time} $\implies$ orange arrow, negatively oriented.
\end{itemize}
An example of these conventions is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TimeVortices}. Utilising these conventions, we see that the first two time slices now appear as Figs.~\ref{fig:PlaqLinkT01}, \ref{fig:PlaqLinkT02}.\\

As we step through time, we expect to see the positively oriented vortices retain their colour but swap direction as they transition from being forwards in time to backwards in time, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexArrows}. The spacetime-oriented vortices act as predictors of vortex motion between slices. To see this, consider Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexMotion}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexMotion1}, we observe a line of four $-1$ (red) spatially-oriented vortices with no spacetime-oriented links associated with them, indicating that this line should remain fixed as we step through time. Alternatively, towards the top of the red line we observe a branching point with two associated $-1$ spacetime-oriented arrows, indicating that this branching point should move in the direction of the spacetime-oriented vortices. Observing the same region at $t=2$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexMotion2}, we see that this is precisely what occurs. The vortex line has remained fixed, whereas the branching point has shifted one lattice spacing to the left, in accordance with the direction indicated by the spacetime-oriented vortex.\\

%

Another example of spacetime-oriented vortices predicting the motion of vortices is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexLineMotion}. Here we see in Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexLineMotion1} a line of three $+1$ spatially-oriented vortices each with an associated $-1$ spacetime-oriented vortex below them. As we step to $t=2$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexLineMotion2} we observe the spacetime-oriented arrows change direction as expected, and the spatially-oriented vortex line shifts one lattice spacing down such that the spacetime-oriented vortices are now above them.\\

%

The cases presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexMotion} and Fig.~\ref{fig:VortexLineMotion} are ideal, where the spatially-oriented vortex shifts only one lattice spacing between time slices. However, it is frequently the case where the spatially-oriented vortices shift multiple lattice spacings per time step. To see how this occurs diagrammatically, consider Fig.~\ref{fig:ComplexStructure}. The shaded red plaquettes indicate the location of a spatially-oriented vortex which would be plotted in the suppressed $\hat{x}$ direction. The red line demonstrates how the centre charge pierces between the two time slices. Within each slice we would observe the spacetime-oriented links shown, however the spatially-oriented vortex appears to move three plaquettes in one time step. These multiple transitions make it harder to track the motion of vortices between time slices; nevertheless, the spacetime-oriented vortices are a useful tool for understanding how centre vortices evolve with time. It is worth making clear that if a spatially-oriented vortex has no associated spacetime-oriented vortices then it is guaranteed to remain stationary. In this respect, the lack of spacetime-oriented vortices is a clear and valuable indicator of vortex behaviour.

\section{Topological Charge}\label{sec:TopChargeVis}
We now wish to observe the relationship between vortices and topological charge. As stated in Sec.~\ref{sec:TopQ}, the topological charge density is given by
%
\begin{equation}
q ( x ) = \frac { 1 } { 32 \pi ^ { 2 } } \, \epsilon _ { \mu \nu \rho \sigma } \, \Tr\left( F _ { \mu \nu }( x ) \, F _ { \rho \sigma }(x) \right) \, .
\end{equation}
%
Given the presence of the antisymmetric tensor, it is clear that for there to be non-trivial topological charge present on the projected vortex configurations, we require that the tangent vectors of the vortex surface span all four dimensions. This condition is met at so-called \textit{singular points}. The contribution to the topological charge from these singular points is discussed in detail in Refs.~\cite{Bruckmann:2003yd,Engelhardt:2010ft,Engelhardt:2000wc,Engelhardt:1999xw}. In our visualisations, these singular points appear as a spatially-oriented vortex running parallel to a spacetime-oriented vortex, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SingularPoint}.\\

Here the vortex surface spans all four directions.]{\label{fig:SingularPoint} The signature of a singular point, in which the vortex surface spans all four directions. The colour and orientation of the vortices is irrelevant, so long as they are parallel.}
\end{figure}
%

We calculate the topological charge via the method outlined in Sec.~\ref{sec:TopQ} on a lattice configuration after eight sweeps of cooling. This cooling is necessary to remove short-range fluctuations, but is a sufficiently low number of sweeps so as to minimally perturb the configuration. We plot regions of positive topological charge in red, and regions of negative topological charge in blue, with a colour gradient to indicate the magnitude. Only topological charge of sufficient magnitude is plotted to better emphasise regions of significant topological charge. Overlaying the topological charge visualisation onto Figs.~\ref{fig:PlaqLinkT01}, \ref{fig:PlaqLinkT02}, we obtain Figs.~\ref{fig:PlaqLinkQT01}, \ref{fig:PlaqLinkQT02}. By studying the regions of high topological charge, we note that we can indeed observe their relationship with singular points, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SingularPointVis}.\\

To quantify the correlation between vortex locations and topological charge, we use the following measure
%
\begin{equation}
C = V\frac{\sum_x |q(x)|\,L(x)}{\sum_x |q(x)|\,\sum_x L(x)}\, ,
\label{eq:TopQCorrelation}
\end{equation}
%
where $V$ is the lattice volume, and
%
\begin{equation}
L(x) = 
\begin{cases}
1\, , & \text{Vortex associated with any plaquette touching $x$}\\
0\, , & \text{No vortex associated with any plaquette touching $x$}\, .
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
In the case of no correlation, $C=1$. If there is correlation or anti-correlation, then $C>1$ or $C<1$ respectively. The value of $C$ for our configurations is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Correlation}, with an average over all 100 configurations of $\bar{C} = 1.46$. This indicates a correlation between vortex locations and regions of high topological charge. Further work to investigate the precise nature of this correlation and its relationship to singular points is planned.\\

\end{figure}
%

Finally, it is also interesting to study the vortex structure of the lattice after cooling. After eight sweeps of cooling, we obtain Fig.~\ref{fig:PlaqLinkTopQ_SW8}. We clearly see that the complexity of the vortex structure has been greatly reduced, however the regions associated with topological charge have been less affected by the smoothing process. We can see this by recalculating the topological charge correlation (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:TopQCorrelation}), shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Correlation_sw07}. The average correlation has increased to a new average of $\bar{C}=1.76$, indicating that the residual vortices show a stronger correlation to the regions of high topological charge than those on the un-cooled configurations. This further supports the previously mentioned notion that cooling serves to isolate `genuine' topological objects and filter out those arising from fluctuations during the Monte-Carlo lattice generation process.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter we have presented a new way to visualise the four-dimensional structure of centre vortices on the lattice through the use of 3D visualisation techniques. These visualisations give new insight into the geometry and time-evolution of vortices, as well as revealing a direct connection to topological charge. The work presented here confirms the qualitative expectations of the centre vortex model. In future it will be valuable to explore the Gribov issue in vortex identification and the sensitivity of our visualisations to the Gribov copy problem. Quantitative studies of branching/monopole points and singular points are also of interest. Studying the change in size of centre vortex loops as the temperature tends towards the deconfining phase would be a worthwhile line of investigation as well. From this work, it is clear that visualisations of centre vortices provide valuable information about the structure of the QCD vacuum that is otherwise not apparent through purely numerical results, and that visualisations elegantly complement the exploration of vortex models.
